            <article class="content">
                <p>We are using the Angular client on my job now and I wanted to do a tutorial to learn the basics. I already did the Tour of heroes tutorial but it was a long time ago and since I don’t code much front end usually, I could use a refresh.</p>
                <p>I need an excuse, thought. If I am making a single page webapp and deploy it, I want it to be useful somehow, not just an exercise. Cue to the most ridiculous app idea you probably read:</p>

                <h4>Lazy oven</h4>

                <img class="articleImage" src="img/angularCli/logo.png" alt="Lazy Oven logo">

                <p>Ok, it was last Christmas holidays. It was my wife’s turn to put the kids to sleep and we decided to have a late dinner afterwards. Some frozen salmon cake made on the oven. While she is telling bedtime stories and singing lullabies, I am making dinner so when the kids are sleep, we can have a bite and maybe watch a TV show if we don’t fall sleep.</p>
                <p>Anyway, when cooking on the oven we have to take into account the time to heat the oven, the time cooking and some minutes after to let the dish cool off a little before start eating. My question is… if we want to start eating at 22:30 and the dish takes 25 minutes to cook, when do I have to start the oven, put in the dish and put it out? A simple subtraction, I know, but it bothers me. Suddenly, it hit me: I want a simple single web app where I can put the time when I want to start eating and the time that takes to cook the dish and then it tells me when to start the oven, put in the dish and put it out.</p>
                <p>I am going to write an example because the pure complexity of the problem may be too much…</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>I want to eat at 22:00 and the (let’s say) pizza, takes 15 minutes to cook, I have to start the oven at 21:30, put the pizza at 21:40 and put it out at 21:55, wait for five minutes and eat at 22:00.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>It is ridiculous, I know, but trust me that I will be using it more than twice.</p>

                <h4>Hands on</h4>

                <p>First step on the Angular CLI tutorial, is to actually install the CLI on your machine:</p>

                <pre><code>
npm install -g @angular/cli
                </code></pre>

                <p><br />Now is the time to create, build, and serve a new, basic Angular project on a development server, go to the parent directory of your new workspace use the following commands:</p>

                <pre><code>
ng new kata-lazy-oven
cd kata-lazy-oven
ng serve
                </code></pre>

                <p>You can now go to localhost:4200 and see the welcome page from Angular:  </p>

                <img src="img/angularCli/welcome.png" alt="Angular welcome page">

                <p><br />Now, this page is not much, but it is something deployable. Before going into modifying this page or adding our Angular components and whatnot, let’s just figure out a way to deploy this default app into Heroku.</p>

                <h4>Deploying on Heroku</h4>

                <p><a href="http://www.joantolos.com/www.heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a> is awesome. I use it for all of my little pet projects and every time that I try some need language or… well, everything that I do, I try to deploy it to production on <a href="http://www.joantolos.com/www.heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a> . That way I deal with the problems and difficulties of pushing the code to production environment and that makes the whole learning experience way more real. Everything works on localhost, always. When you have to deal with a real database and a real environment, you will face problems that will provide you very useful skills.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create an account on Heroku if you don’t already have one.</li>
                    <li>Create the app “kata-lazy-oven” (or any other name that you like but it will have to be consistent with the one on the code)</li>
                    <li>Connect your app to your github repo where you have the code. You can configure it to build and deploy on every push. There are a lot of continuous delivery and integration that Heroku offers out of the box</li>
                </ol>
                <p><a href="http://www.joantolos.com/www.heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a> offers a lot of cool features like logging, a bunch of add-ons and a lot of them go for free. Don’t miss it.</p>

                <h4>Modifying the Angular default app too be deployed on Heroku</h4>

                <p>We have to do several minor modifications on the code generated by de Angular client.</p>

                <h5>Using Express</h5>

                <p>We are going to need something to serve our files. Let’s go with Express . We will also need “path” to setup our server.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <pre><code>
npm install --save express path
                </code></pre>                

                <p><br />Create a server file. In your main application directory create a file called server.js and add the following code:</p>

                <pre><code>
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();
                
// Serve static files....
app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/dist/kata-lazy-oven'));
                
// Send all requests to index.html
app.get('/*', function(req, res) {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname + '/dist/kata-lazy-oven/index.html'));
});
                
// default Heroku PORT
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 8080);
                </code></pre>
                
                <h5>Proper scripts configuration</h5>

                <p>When we push code to Heroku, the scripts listed in the package.json file will be consulted, and if we have any preinstall or postinstall scripts, they will be run at the appropriate times. What we want to do in this scenario is have the build command run after the dependencies have been installed.</p>

                <p>So, open the package.json file, add this postinstall script and change the start script from “ng serve” to “node server.js”:</p>

                <pre><code>
"scripts": {
    ...
    "start": "node server.js",
    "postinstall": "ng build --aot --prod"
}
                </code></pre>

                <h5>Push to Git, check the app</h5>

                <p>If you have configured your app on Heroku to deploy when a changed is pushed to the repository, the build will be already in progress. If not, just deploy the app, wait until the build is finished and check the url:</p>

                <p><a href="https://kata-lazy-oven.herokuapp.com/">https://kata-lazy-oven.herokuapp.com/</a></p>

                <p>At this point in time, you should see the exact same Angular welcome page that you see on localhost. It doesn’t do much, but it is something online. Of course, I have named the app “kata-lazy-oven”, but you can named it as you wish.</p>
