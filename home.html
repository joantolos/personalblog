            <p>Let’s say we want to go from Paris to Amsterdam and I ask you for an algorithm to solve that problem. The problem being I need to go from point A to point B. You can answer… “well, you take a plane”. Ok, a little more specific… “You take your car from your home to the airport, then take a plane, and when in Paris, rent a car from the airport to the hotel”.</p>

            <h2>WHAT IS A REST API</h2>

            <h5>Using Kotlin and Spring to build a REST API, Sept 2, 2021</h5>
            <div class="thumbnail3"></div>
            <p>I have been wanting to use Kotlin for a while now. Some colleges that I deeply respect don’t stop recommending it and I finally allocated some time to play around a little bit. To test this new language (new to me, anyway) I want to try and implement something familiar to me so I don’t have to bother with the domain or anything. I am going to implement the same REST API that I did with Java sometime ago.</p>
